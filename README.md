# UFOs Webpage

## Purpose
Dana is interested in showing the data that she has gathered about UFO sightings around the world. She wants to present the data in a webpage that includes a dynamic table with filters to easily search for the data based on specific criteria. We have used JavaScript coding language and formatting packages to create the webpage that Dana envisions.

## Results
This webpage includes several filter text boxes, where users can type a specific date, city, state, country, or shape to show the data that fit the given criteria. 

For example, if we wanted to view the sightings in Arkansas then we would fill in the state text box with an "ar". After filling in the state text box, we would then click anywhere on our table or press Enter to see the filtered data.

To return back to our main table, we would empty all of our text boxes and then click anywhere on the table or press Enter. This will show us the first few rows in our table without any filters.

## Summary & Recommendations
This webpage provides Dana with an effective table that can show the data with simple filtering capabilities, however, there are a few drawbacks that come with our current design. The filtering system can be confusing without providing much instruction to the user. There aren't clear instructions that demonstrate how to apply the filters. Although it is pretty user friendly, we can improve the webpage by including a block of text that shows how to use the filters or we can add a "Filter Data" button that can easily apply the filters.

A second observation is that the text inputs are case sensitive and do not show data when capital letters are used. For example, if someone searches California using the abbreviations "CA", then they would not see any data in the table. There are a couple of solutions that we can suggest to Dana to improve this part of the webpage. We can either provide specific instructions to use lower-case letters only, reprogram our code to allow more flexibility in the text input, or we can provide a list of all the dates, cities, states, countries, and shapes within the data so the user can input the correct value.
